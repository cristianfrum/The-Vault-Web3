Welcome to the vault!

The vault enables multiple users to join a wallet. Here is the list of the benefits:

- Each wallet has public funds that can be withdrawn by each member of the wallet with no limitations.
- When a wallet is created, it has an owner, members and hourly withdrawal limits set for each member.
- The wallet enables each member to have it's own private ETH storage
- Each wallet has a transaction list that displays all the internal and external transactions

Use cases:

- A family wants to save some money and set up withdrawal limits for each member, but also share a public fund that is meant to help any member in need.
- School groups that have a public fund, but each parent wants to make sure that the children do not spend more than allowed.
